## Asteroids Fork - Game Settings Tool
By Joakim Karbing
Aiming for bare minimum, just showing that i know how to make a tool and make use of scriptable objects.

1. Before playing the game, create a game settings asset.
2. The tool for creating a game settings asset can be found under Tools->Game Settings
The game settings asset is automatically applied and the game can be played right away.
3. If you want to change settings, create a new asset using the same method.



The scripts i made for this are found in the assets root folder.

The Scriptable object that is created after using the tool is found in resources.

I've made minor changes to the games scripts overall to support the changes made to the game by the tool.

If the tool isn't responding for some reason or fail to create/update an asset, close it down and re-open it and it will work.
