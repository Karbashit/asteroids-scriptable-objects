## Asteroids - Game Settings Tool
#By Joakim Karbing

1. Before playing the game, create a game settings asset.
2. The game settings asset can be found under Tools->Game Settings
The game settings asset is automatically applied and the game can be played right away.
3. If you want to change settings, create a new asset using the same method.

#The scripts i made for this are found in the assets root folder.
#The Scriptable object that is created after using the tool is found in resources.
